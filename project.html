    <p>CIBIL Score check by Banks / NBFC is the first step whenever you apply for any
        loan or credit card by using your PAN CARD. If youâ€™re CIBIL Score is 750+, then your loan /
        card application is further processed. If you have settlement in last one year or CIBIL score is
        below 750 points your application will be rejected automatically. So before apply for
        loan / Credit card you can check your CIBIL Score with Deal for loans free of cost. You just
        have to enter few details and report is in front of you within few seconds.
        The project CIBIL system is a web based application that keeps track of people's credit scores
        and dues. The system is similar to the real CIBIL system with an enhancement. The interesting
        feature is that any defaulter can view his status and can apply for improvement by good
        behaviour.</p>
