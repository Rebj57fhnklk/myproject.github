        "Hello Everyone !!  I am Arpitha S R As a recent information science & engineering graduate, 
        I am enthusiastic about entering the world of technology and software
        development. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in
        programming language such as Core Java(J2SE), SQL, Android application 
        Development as well as problem-solving skills that I'm eager to apply
        in real-world scenarios. During my time at S T J Instutute of technology Ranebennur,
        I collaborated on projects that honed my skills in algorithmic thinking and software development.

        I am particularly excited about web development and have experience
        creating responsive and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        and have more experience creating android applications using XML, java and PHP.
        As I embark on my career, I am open to opportunities that will allow me to further
        develop my skills, contribute to innovative projects, and work with a dynamic 
        team of professionals. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated 
        with the latest trends in technology.
        
        If you are looking for a passionate and dedicated entry-level software 
        developer who is eager to make an impact, I would love to connect and explore
        potential collaborations. Let's build the future of technology together."</pre>
